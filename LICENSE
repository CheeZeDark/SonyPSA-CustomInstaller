6. VIOLATION OF AGREEMENT; TERMINATION OF RIGHTS AND SIE REMEDIES 
If SIE has evidence to determine that you have violated this Agreement's terms, SIE may itself or may 
procure the taking of any action to protect its interests such as disabling access to or use of some or all 
of the Software, disabling use of the Product online or offline, termination of your access to the 
PlayStation Network, denial of any warranty, repair or other services provided for the Product, 
implementation of automatic or mandatory updates or devices intended to discontinue unauthorized 
use, or reliance on any other remedial efforts as reasonably necessary to prevent the use of modified or 
unpermitted use of the Software. The actions that SIE may take, and the duration of those actions, will 
be limited to what is objectively necessary to protect you, SIE’s interests and those of other users. 
SIE, its affiliates, and licensors reserve the right to bring legal action in the event of a violation of this 
Agreement. SIE may participate in governmental or private legal action or investigation relating to your 
use of the Software. 
7. EXPORT CONTROL AND COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS 
The Software may contain technology that is subject to certain restrictions under export-control laws 
and regulations. As such, the Software may not be exported or re-exported to persons and entities in 
violation of these laws and regulations. You must comply with these laws when using the Software. 
8. BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION FOR CERTAIN RESIDENTS 
The following terms in this Section 8, to the fullest extent permitted under law, apply to you if you are a 
resident of the United States or a country/region in North, Central or South America. 
The term "Dispute" means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and SIE, Sony Interactive 
Entertainment LLC, any of their current or former affiliates, or any predecessor or successor entity to 
any of the foregoing, including Sony Computer Entertainment Inc., Sony Computer Entertainment 
America LLC, and Sony Interactive Entertainment America LLC ("Sony Entity") regarding any and all uses 
of the Software, including but not limited to, the collection, use, storage or disclosure of data resulting 
from any use of the Software, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including 
fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, 
and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Section 8 (with the exception of the 
enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). "Dispute" has the broadest possible meaning 
that will be enforced. 
If you have a Dispute (other than one described as excluded from arbitration below) with any Sony 
Entity or a Sony Entity's officers, directors, employees and agents ("Adverse Sony Entity") that cannot be 
resolved through negotiation as required below, you and the Adverse Sony Entity must seek resolution 
of the Dispute only through arbitration of that Dispute according to Section 8's terms and not litigate 
that Dispute in court. Arbitration means that the Dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead 
of in a court by a judge or jury. 
YOU AND THE SONY ENTITIES AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY A SONY ENTITY IN SMALL 
CLAIMS COURT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 8. 
IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS 
SECTION 8, YOU MUST NOTIFY SIE IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS 
AGREEMENT. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE MAILED TO SONY INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT 
INC. CARE OF SONY INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT LLC, 2207 BRIDGEPOINTE PARKWAY, SAN MATEO, 
CA 94404, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT – WAIVER AND MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR 
ADDRESS, (3) YOUR SIGN-IN ID, IF YOU HAVE ONE, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT 
WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH ANY SONY ENTITY THROUGH ARBITRATION. 
IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ANY SONY ENTITY, YOU MUST SEND WRITTEN NOTICE TO SONY 
INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT INC. CARE OF SONY INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT LLC, 2207 
BRIDGEPOINTE PARKWAY, SAN MATEO, CA 94404, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT - DISPUTE RESOLUTION 
TO GIVE THE ADVERSE SONY ENTITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY 
THROUGH NEGOTIATION. 
You agree to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no fewer than 60 days after you 
provide notice of the Dispute. If the Adverse Sony Entity does not resolve your Dispute within 60 days 
from its receipt of notice of the Dispute, you or the Adverse Sony Entity may pursue your claim in 
arbitration pursuant to the terms in this Section 8. 
ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED 
ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR 
UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE ADVERSE SONY ENTITY SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN 
WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION. 
If you or the Adverse Sony Entity elect to resolve your Dispute through arbitration, the party initiating 
the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), 
www.adr.org, or JAMS www.jamsadr.com. This Section 8's terms govern if they conflict with the rules of 
the arbitration organization that the parties select. 
You and the Sony Entities agree that this arbitration agreement evidences a transaction in interstate 
commerce and thus the substantive and procedural provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act and the 
AAA rules identified below govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 8. For claims of 
less than $75,000, the AAA Supplementary Procedures for Consumer–Related Disputes (“Supplementary 
Procedures”) will apply, including the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in section C-8 of the 
Supplementary Procedures. For claims exceeding $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and 
relevant fee schedules for non-class action proceedings will apply. 
The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Further, if your claims do not 
exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to and negotiated in good faith with the Adverse Sony Entity as 
described above, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be 
entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to 
any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to the Adverse Sony Entity 
or you. 
The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless 
requested by a party. The arbitrator's award will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal 
provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes 
of enforcement. 
You or the Adverse Sony Entity may initiate arbitration in either San Mateo County, California or the 
county in which you reside. If you select the county of your residence, the Adverse Sony Entity may 
transfer the arbitration to San Mateo County if it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as 
a result of the change in location as determined by the arbitrator. 
If any clause within this Section 8 (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is illegal or 
unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section 8, and the remainder of this Section 8 will 
be given full effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire 
Section 8 will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court. 
This Section 8 survives this Agreement's termination. 
9. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE 
If you reside in Japan or country/region located in East Asia or Southeast Asia, this Agreement is 
governed by, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Japan except for its conflict of 
law rules. Any dispute arising under or in relation to this Agreement shall be exclusively submitted to the 
Tokyo District Court in Tokyo, Japan. 
If you reside in Europe, Africa, Australia and Oceania, Middle East, India, Ukraine or the Russian 
Federation, this Agreement is governed by, construed and interpreted in accordance with English Law 
but you will have the additional protection of the mandatory laws of the country/region you live in. You 
can enforce this Agreement in a court of competent jurisdiction in the country/region in which you live 
or in England and Wales.  
If you reside elsewhere, this Agreement is governed by, construed and interpreted in accordance with 
the laws of the State of California except for its conflict of law rules. If you are a resident of the United 
States, any Dispute not subject to arbitration and not initiated in small claims court must be litigated in a 
court of competent jurisdiction in either the Superior Court for the State of California in the County of 
San Mateo or in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. 
10. GENERAL LEGAL 
You are bound by this Agreement's most current version. To access a current version of this Agreement, 
go to https://www.playstation.com/legal/product-ssla/. Your continued access to or use of the Software 
will signify your acceptance of the latest version of this Agreement. 
If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and 
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in any way. 
You acknowledge that your breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable injury to SIE for which 
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and that SIE is entitled to equitable relief in 
addition to any other remedies it may have under law. 
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and SIE with respect to the Software and 
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding its subject matter. No failure to 
exercise and no delay in exercising any right under this Agreement operates as a waiver of that right. SIE 
may assign any of its rights under this Agreement, including its rights to enforce this Agreement's terms, 
to any SIE affiliate.
